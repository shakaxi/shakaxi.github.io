#+TITLE: Simulation - Large Scale Modelling
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

In the system-level simulation (SLS), large scale attenuation needs to be modelled. /Coupling loss/ is defined as the combination of distance-dependent path loss, shadow fading, antenna gain at the transmitter and receiver, outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) penetration loss[fn:5].
- Path loss is usually dependent on propagation types, i.e. line-of-sight (LOS) or non-line-of-sight (NLOS).
- Propagation type, LOS/NLOS, is per site[fn:1].
- Location type, i.e. indoor or outdoor, is per user[fn:2].
- Shadow fading is per user[fn:3].
- O2I penetration loss is per user[fn:4].

* Footnotes

[fn:5] O2I penetration loss is usually considered for indoor users in the case that base stations are placed outdoor.

[fn:4] O2I penetration loss is an inherent property of a user, shared by all the channels to a user.

[fn:3] The shadow fading is shared by all the channels to a user.

[fn:2] Location type is an inherent property of a user.

[fn:1] All the sectors/cells of one site share the same propagation type.
