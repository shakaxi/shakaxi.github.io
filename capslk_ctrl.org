#+TITLE: Turn CapsLock into Control

* Background
Usually, key /CapsLock/ is seldom used in our daily utilization, while key /Control/ is frequently used, esp. for Emacs users. Therefore, we can turn /Capslock/ into an additional /Control/.
* Installation and configuration
Install /xmodmap/ software, e.g. run the following command for ArchLinux.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pacman -S xorg-xmodmap
#+END_SRC

Create a =~/.Xmodmap= with its contents as follows
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
add Control = Control_L
#+END_SRC

Make it take effect at every boot by appending the following line to =~/.xprofile=.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
#+END_SRC
