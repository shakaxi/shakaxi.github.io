* Introduction
In NR system, /channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS)/ can be utilized for
- CSI acquisition
- Beam management
- Tracking
- Mobility management
- Rate match
* CSI-RS for CSI Acquisition
In NR system, a CSI-RS resource can be configured with up to 32 antenna ports, i.e., 1/2/4/8/12/16/24/32. Moreover, 8/12/16/24/32-port CSI-RS is comprised of 2/4-port CSI-RS.
- A single-port CSI-RS resource occupies one RE.
- A 2-port CSI-RS resource occupies 2 x 1 RE's.
- A 4-port CSI-RS resource occupies 4 x 1 or 2 x 2 RE's.

The coordinate of a CSI-RS resource in the resource grid is indicated by a bitmap.
* CSI-RS for Tracking
In NR system, a single-port CSI-RS is used as /tracking reference signal (TRS)/, targetting for time/frequency tracking.

- /Periodic TRS/ is essentially a periodic CSI-RS resource set, which is configured by high layer signalling.
- /Aperiodic TRS/ has the same structure as periodic TRS. The difference lies that it is triggered by /downlink control information (DCI)/.
* CSI-RS for Rate Match
In NR system, zero-power (ZP) CSI-RS can be used for rate match, which is exclusive for PDSCH transmission. There are 3 types of ZP-CSI-RS, periodic, semi-persistent, and aperiodic.
