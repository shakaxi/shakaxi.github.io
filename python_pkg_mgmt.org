#+TITLE: Python - Package Management

* Introduction
One of the most charmful characters of Python is its a rich number of packages. Accordingly, package managers emerge, e.g., =pip=, =setuptools=. This post just briefly introduce the usage of =pip=.
* Installation
In ArchLinux system, =pip= can be easily installed by
#+begin_src sh
  pacman -S python-pip
#+end_src
As a dependency, =python= will also be installed if it has not yet.
* Configuration
Similar to the package manager of Linux operation systems, =pip= connects with, synchronizes to, and downloads from websites. For the sake of download speed maximization, =pip= is encouraged to visit the nearest mirror site, which can be configured by editing =/etc/pip.conf=, e.g.,
#+begin_src sh
  [global]
  index-url = https://mirrors.163.com/pypi/simple
#+end_src
* Usage
** Install package(s)
#+begin_src sh
  pip install PKG_NAMES
#+end_src
** Upgrade package(s)
#+begin_src sh
  pip install --upgrade PKG_NAMES
  pip install -U PKG_NAMES
#+end_src
** Uninstall package(s)
#+begin_src sh
  pip uninstall PKG_NAMES
#+end_src
** List installed packages
#+begin_src sh
  pip list
#+end_src
** Search a package
#+begin_src sh
  pip search KEY_WORDS
#+end_src
** Show information of an installed package
