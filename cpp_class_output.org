#+title: C++ - Output Object

In object oriented programming (OOP) based C++ program, we usually need to output the properties and members of one or more objects. In this case, overriding the ostream operator, =<<=, is a convenient and intuitional method. Here is an example for class =CLASS=.

* =class.h=
#+begin_src C++
  #include <ostream>

  class CLASS
  {
  private:
      int mem_int;
      double mem_double;
  public:
      CLASS();
      friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& str, const CLASS& c);
  };
#+end_src
* =class.cpp=
#+begin_src C++
  #include <class.h>

  std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& str, const CLASS& c)
  {
      str << c.mem_int << ',' << c.mem_double;
      return str;
  }
#+end_src
