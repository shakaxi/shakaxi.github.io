#+TITLE: LTE - PCFICH

As its name implies, /physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH)/ indicates the size of the control region, or equivalently the position where data region starts, of the instant subframe in terms of the number of OFDM symbols.

There are totally 2 bits for PCFICH corresponding to the three candidate control region sizes. As illustrated in Figure [[fig:lte-pcfich]], the 2-bit payload is first coded into a 32-bit codeword, i.e. the code rate is 1/16, and then scrambled by a cell-specific and subframe-specific sequence to randomize and whiten the /inter-cell interference (ICI)/. After that, the codeword is modulated as 16 QPSK symbols and mapped to 4 /resource element groups (REG's)/[fn:1] in the first OFDM symbol of each subframe. Targetting for frequency diversity, the spacing between each two adjacent REG's is 1/4 of the bandwidth.

[fn:1] One REG means 4 resource elements (RE's) in frequency domain.
