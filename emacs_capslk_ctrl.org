#+TITLE: Emacs - CapsLock as Control

* Background
Usually, key =CapsLock= is seldom used in our daily utilization, while key =Control= is frequently used, esp. for Emacs users. Therefore, we can turn =Capslock= into an additional =Control=.
* Configuration
Regarding Gnome and KDE, it is extremely easy to turn =CapsLock= into an additional =Control=. Taking Gnome for instance, following two steps are required.
** Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pacman -S gnome-tweak-tool
#+END_SRC
** Configuration
Open the installed =Tweak Tool=. Enter =Typing= -> =Caps Lock key behavior= and tick the radio =Caps Lock is also a Ctrl=.
