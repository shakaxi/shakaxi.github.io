#+title: Aurora - A LaTeX Plugin for Microsoft Word

[[http://elevatorlady.ca][Aurora]] is an excellent LaTeX addon, which enables LaTeX based mathematical support, including a variety of symbols and equations.

For Microsoft Office-32, there is a dedicated tab for Aurora in Word. For Office-64, however, there is no tab at all. In this case, aurora has to be activated by =insert= \to =object=. Clearly, the access is neither direct nor convenience. Targetting better convenience, macros can be defined and then placed in a card, e.g., following scripts define two macros, =aurora_inline= and =aurora_display=, to input inline and display style equations.
#+begin_src sh
  Sub aurora_inline()
  Selection.InlineShapes.AddOLEObject ClassType:="Equation.Ribbit", FileName:="", LinkToFile:=False, DisplayAsIcon:=False
  End Sub

  Sub aurora_display()
  Selection.TypeParagraph
  Selection.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = wdAlignParagraphCenter
  Selection.InlineShapes.AddOLEObject ClassType:="Equation.Ribbit", FileName:="", LinkToFile:=False, DisplayAsIcon:=False
  End Sub
#+end_src
