#+TITLE: Linux - WiFi6

Today, I found the wireless network card (Intel Corporation Wi-Fi 6 AX201) is suffering random disconnection. Maybe there is something wrong with the driver in Linux.

After several rounds of searching and trying, the problem can be solved by disabling the 11n and 11ac modes, as well as power saving.

For ArchLinux, following two lines can be inserted in file =/etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf=.
#+begin_src sh
  options iwlwifi power_save=0
  options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1 11ac_disable=1
#+end_src
