#+TITLE: Export Org File to HTML5 Slide
#+OPTIONS: num:6

* Introduction
As is well-known, [[http://orgmode.org][orgmode]] is a famous major mode of [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]. What deserves notice, it can export org files to a variety of formats, e.g. \LaTeX, pdf, text, freemind.

Today, I found an interesting export backend, =ox-ioslide=, whereby org files can be directly exported to html5 slides.
* Installation
It can be easily installed via Emacs's =ELPA= system.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x package-install ox-ioslide
#+END_SRC
After that, the backend can be automatically loaded by adding following line in =.emacs=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-ioslide)
#+END_SRC
* Usage
After the installation, an org file can be exported to html5 slides through the built-in exporter.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
C-c C-e i h
#+END_SRC
