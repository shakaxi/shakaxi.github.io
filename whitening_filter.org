#+TITLE: Whitening Filter

Usually, we need to filter a mixture of desired signal and colored noise, in order to make the spectrum of the noise become white.

Without loss of generality, $x(t)$ is a wide-sense stationary stochastic process. If it is taken as input by a /linear time invariant (LTI)/ system $W$ and the output process $n(t)$ has white power spectrum, i.e., /power spectrum density (PSD)/ equal to 1; then the system $W$ is termed the /whitening filter/ of process $x(t)$, and $n(t)$ is termed the /innovation process/ of $x(t)$. If $n(t)$ is input into the inverse system of $W$, denoted by $W^{-1}$, then the output is the original process $x(t)$ and system $W^{-1}$ is the corresponding /innovation fitler/, as shown in Figure [[whitening_innovation]].

Provided a multidimensional stochastic vector $\mathbf{x}$, with covariance
\begin{align}
  \mathrm{Var}[\mathbf{x}] = \mathrm{E} \left[ \mathbf{x} \mathbf{x}^H\right], \label{eq:var-x}
\end{align}
if its whitening filter is $\mathbf{H}$, then its output $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Hx}$ should have unit covariance, i.e.,
\begin{align}
\mathrm{Var}[\mathbf{y}] &= \mathrm{E} \left[ \mathbf{y} \mathbf{y}^H\right] \nonumber \\
&= \mathrm{E} \left[ \mathbf{Hx} \mathbf{x}^H \mathbf{H}^H \right] \nonumber \\
&= \mathbf{I}. \label{eq:var-y}
\end{align}
Clearly, equation \eqref{eq:var-y} holds if and only if $\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{L}^{-1}$, where $\mathbf{L}\mathbf{L}^H = \mathrm{Var}[\mathbf{x}]$.
