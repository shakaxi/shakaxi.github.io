#+TITLE: Archlinux - A Non-Official Repository from Chinese Community

* Introducation
[[https://archlinux.org][Archlinux]] is an excellent Linux distribution, which follows the principle of /keep it simple and stupid (KISS)/ closely. Besides the official repositories, its Chinese community provides a non-official repository, a.k.a. ArchlinuxCN.
* Configuration
Using the ArchlinuxCN can be completed by two steps.
1. Append following lines to =/etc/pacman.conf=.
   #+begin_src shell
     [archlinuxcn]
     Server = https://repo.archlinuxcn.org/$arch
   #+end_src
   Optionally, there are many mirrors, which can be found at https://github.com/archlinuxcn/mirrorlist-repo, e.g.,
   - Aliyun
     #+begin_src shell
       [archlinuxcn]
       Server = https://mirrors.aliyun.com/archlinuxcn/$arch
     #+end_src
   - Netease
     #+begin_src shell
       [archlinuxcn]
       Server = https://mirrors.163.com/archlinux-cn/$arch
     #+end_src
2. Import the corresponding PGP keys by installing package =archlinuxcn-keyring=.
   #+begin_src shell
     pacman -S archlinuxcn-keyring
   #+end_src
