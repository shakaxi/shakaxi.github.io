#+TITLE: Fonts from Adobe

Recently, I found several fonts from Adobe. What's beyond my expectation, they are so excellent and can meet all my requirements. They are /adobe-source-code-pro-fonts/, /adobe-source-sans-pro-fonts/ and /adobe-source-serif-pro-fonts/.

For ArchLinux subscribers, the fonts can be easily installed via =pacman=.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pacman -S adobe-source-{code,sans,serif}-pro-fonts
#+END_SRC

After the installation, the fonts will be ready for use.
