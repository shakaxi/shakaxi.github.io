Network time protocol (NTP) is a very convenient service which can provide network time synchronized automatically and periodically. This post briefly describes the installation and configuration of NTP on Linux OS.
* Installation
Without loss of generality, we take Arch Linux for instance here.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pacman -S ntp
#+END_SRC
* Configuration
** Prepend following line(s) to =/etc/ntp.conf=.
- As server
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
server 127.127.1.1
fudge 127.127.1.1 stratum 12
#+END_SRC
- As client
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
server IP_ADDRESS
#+END_SRC
** Start and enable the service
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
