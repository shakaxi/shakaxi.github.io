#+TITLE: Emacs - Dired

* Introduction
Aside from editing files, including local and remote ones, Emacs can also play the role of a file manager, i.e., manipulating directories and the files by its directory editor, /dired/.
* Enter dired buffer
Dired can be entered in following ways:
- Command: =M-x dired=
- Key bindings
  + =C-x d= is equivalent to the command above.
  + =C-x 4 d= open a dired buffer in another window.

* Working across directories
In dired buffer, typing =i= on a directory will insert it in the same dired buffer as a sub-directory.

By inserting multiple directories into a shared dired buffer, you can not only glance at multiple directories simultaneously but you can also work across them as if they were one large virtual directory.
