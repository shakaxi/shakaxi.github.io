#+title: Matrix Cookbook
#+latex_header: \DeclareMathOperator{\vec}{vec}

As is well-known, [[http://matrixcookbook.com][the matrix cookbook]] is an excellent manual relating to matrices worthy of keeping at hands. In this post, I just pick a partial number of entries out of the complete cookbook, which are usually used by myself.

\begin{align*}
  \vec(\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}) &= (\mathbf{I} \otimes \mathbf{A}) \vec(\mathbf{B}) \\
  &= (\mathbf{B}^T \otimes \mathbf{I}) \vec(\mathbf{A})
\end{align*}
