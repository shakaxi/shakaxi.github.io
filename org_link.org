#+TITLE: Orgmode - Link

* Introduction
[[http://orgmode.org][Orgmode]] is an extremely powerful tool for get thing done (GTD), project planning, note keeping, etc.

Orgmode makes it fairly easy to insert, edit, and reference to a variety types of links.
* Format
The general format for a link looks like =[[link][description]]= or =[[link]]=. If the description is a file name or URL that points to an image, HTML export will inline the image as a clickable button. If there is no description and the link points to an image, the image will be inlined into the exported HTML file.
** Internal links
An internal link is used to mark an object and assign it a number. The marked object can be referenced by links pointing to it. Particularly, links without description appear as the number assigned.

- An entry with the =CUSTOM_ID= property of =my-custom-id= can be referenced to as =[[#my-custom-id]]=.
- =[[My Target]]= or =[[My Target][Find my target]]= leads to a text search in the current file for the corresponding target =<<My Target>>=.
** Targeted links
File links can contain additional information for more precise jumping, which can be a line number or a search option after a double colon.
