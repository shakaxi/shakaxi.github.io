#+TITLE: Linux - Zathura

* Introduction
/Zathura/ is a light PDF viewer, with Vi/Vim-like keybindings. It always reloads and refreshes documents automatically. In this sense, it is naturally capable of providing real time preview of a PDF file, e.g., produced by LaTeX. Additionally, it has the option of enabling inverse search based on /synctex/.
