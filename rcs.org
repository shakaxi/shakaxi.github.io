#+TITLE: Using RCS
#+OPTIONS: num:6

/RCS/ is the abbreviation of revision control system, which is efficient and easy to use. This article, taking ArchLinux for example, aims to illustrate how to install and use it.

Above all, for ArchLinux, RCS can be easily installed by running
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pacman -S rcs
#+END_SRC
Then it can be used immediately without further configuration. The usage can be listed as follows:

- =ci -u FILENAME=: check in or intialize the file =FILENAME=;
- =co -l FILENAME=: check out =FILENAME= and lock it;
- =rlog FILENAME=: display the log of changes for =FILENAME=;
- =rcdiff FILENAME=: compare =FILENAME= of different versions;
- =rcs -u FILENAME=: override the locked =FILENAME=.
