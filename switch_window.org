#+TITLE: Switching Window in Emacs
#+OPTIONS: num:6

In Emacs, multi-window editing is usually the case in our routine utilization. Fast and convenient switch among multiple windows is very necessary. So long as I am concerned, there are at least three methods.
- Legacy method :: built-in elisp function =other-window=, binded to key =C-x o=.
- Package window-numbering :: can be installed via ELPA and configured by inserting =(window-numbering-mode 1)= to =~/.emacs=. The window switching is binded to =Meta= key with a window index.
- Package ace-window :: Ace-like functionality, can be installed by ELPA and configured as below[fn:1].
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "M-s") 'ace-window)
#+END_SRC

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Herein, the window switching is binded to key =M-s=. After pressing the key, the first character of each window will be highlighted and replaced with an assigned index. The user can switch to the desired window by inputing the corresponding index.
