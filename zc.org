#+TITLE: Zadoff-Chu Sequence
#+DATE: <2015-09-08 Tue>

* Introduction
The /Zadoff-Chu/ sequence[fn:1] is named after Solomon A. Zadoff and D. C. Chu, which is a constant amplitude zero auto-correlation (CAZAC) sequence[fn:2]
with its cylically shifted versions are zero correlated, i.e. orthogonal to each other. A ZC sequence without cyclic shift is termed a /root sequence/, which can be expressed as
\begin{align*}
x_u(n) = e^{-j\frac{\pi u n (n+1+2q)}{L}}, \quad n = 0, 1, \ldots, L-1,
\end{align*}
where $L$ is the length of the sequence and $q \in \mathbb{Z}$.
* Properties
- The auto-correlation of a ZC sequence with one of its cyclically shifted version equals zero.
- ZC sequences with odd length are periodic, i.e. $x_u(n + L) = x_u(n)$.
- For a ZC sequence with odd length, its DFT is another ZC sequence.
- The cross-correlation between two prime length ZC sequences, $x_{u_1}(n)$ and $x_{u_2}(n)$, is constant $\sqrt{L}$, provided that $u_1 - u_2$ is relative prime to $L$.
* Applications
ZC sequences are widely used in 3GPP LTE/LTE-Advanced system
- Primary synchronization signal (PSS)
- Random access preamble
- Uplink demodulation reference signal (DMRS)
- Sounding reference signal (SRS)
